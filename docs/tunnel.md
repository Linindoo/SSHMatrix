## Tunnel Template

For frequently used tunnels that require activation on various servers, it is advisable to incorporate them into a tunnel template. When establishing a connection, select the relevant template to integrate the specified tunnels. By doing so, upon initiating a connection session, the corresponding tunnels will be automatically generated.
